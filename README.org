* My Emacs Flatpak 
** with Pure-GTK interface and native-comp (lisp on libGCCjit)

This a pre-configured flatpak manifest to build an emacs branch with libjanson, libgccjit and dependencies.
This uses the latest releases of of all components, except for gcc, which has jit fixes in-tree and emacs, which has the experimental code bringing everything together.

This simply glues everything together to in a trackable package rather than installing to =/usr/local/=

If you'd prefer traditional =./configure && make && make install= checkout the 'pgtk-nativecomp' branch here: https://github.com/fejfighter/emacs

** Building
   Based off the official documentation:
   https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/first-build.html

1. =flatpak install org.gnome.sdk= (might also want to install the relevant theme you prefer)
2. =flatpak-builder --force-clean --user --install  build-dir org.gnu.emacs.json= - this will take some time

Rebuilding is simply repeating step 2
